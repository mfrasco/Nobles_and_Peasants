                <h3>What is the Pledge Allegiance box?</h3>
                <p>If you are a peasant, you must pledge allegiance to some noble in order to buy a drink. When you do that, the cost of your drinks will be paid for with that noble's coin.</p>

                <h3>What is the Get a Quest box?</h3>
                <p>Peasants and Nobles receive coin when they perform quests. Peasants want more coin because they need coin to become a noble. Nobles want more coin because, if they run out of coin, they become a peasant. Quests can be performed on behalf of someone else.</p>

                <p>When you kill someone, you take their money, their status, and their soldiers.</p>
