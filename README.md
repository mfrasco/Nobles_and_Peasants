# Nobles and Peasants

**Nobles have the money. Peasants have the power.** When you place your party in this world, you decide how you want it to all turn out. This is not a theme party. Nobles and Peasants provides a minimal amount of structure for your imagination to run wild.

Nobles and peasants is structured around getting alcohol. In order to get a drink, you need to spend some amount of coin, which is the fake currency used in the party. When they enter the party, **nobles are given some amount of coin and peasants are given nothing**. If a peasant wants to get a drink, he or she must use a noble's coin to drink. Drinking on a noble's tab is called pledging allegiance to the noble or entering the noble's army. A noble would allow a peasant to use his or her coin because **the noble with the most peasants in their army is the almighty ruler of heaven and earth**.

### This sounds cool
If you are really interested in this idea and you want to make it more complex, Nobles and Peasants allows you to do that. You can get coin by performing a dare. A peasant can overthrow a noble. You can create your own adventure.

### This sounds lame
If you are not interested in this idea, Nobles and Peasants doesn't force you to participate too much. Just join a noble's army and drink off of his or her tab the rest of the night. You don't have to get involved with the Nobles and Peasants world. You can just have fun like any other typical party.
